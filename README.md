📌 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier with Hyperparameter Tuning
This project demonstrates the implementation of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model using scikit-learn, with added steps for data preprocessing, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

🧠 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to classify a given dataset using the KNN algorithm while experimenting with different values of k and preprocessing techniques to improve model accuracy. The project also includes hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV to find the optimal configuration for the classifier.

🛠️ Libraries & Tools Used
pandas – Data manipulation

numpy – Numerical operations

matplotlib & seaborn – Data visualization

scikit-learn – Machine learning model, preprocessing, and evaluation:

KNeighborsClassifier – Core KNN algorithm
